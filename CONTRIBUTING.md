# Contributing to FrankenReact

Thank your for your interest in contributing to our project!

Pull requests and feature requests via issues are always welcome.

If you want to add your own feature, you can open a pull request. Keep in mind, that I might not accept all features as I am trying to keep frankenreact's code usefull for most dashboard applications. If you're in doubt, open a "New Feature" request issue to see if I am willing to accept your feature before developing it.

For all Pull requests, you must follow the coding style of the existing files (based on eslint/prettier) and commit guidelines of commitizen.

If you found any bugs, inconsistencies or inaccuracies, or have suggestions on how to improve this project, then I would be happy to hear from you in an issue.
